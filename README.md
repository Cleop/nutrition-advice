# Nutrition Advice
## Week 3 - API Project - An educational tool for food

## What?
- Build a website that utlises at least 2 APIs
- **Chosen subject matter:** food and nutrition education  
We are going to build a website that provides nutritional information for users.

## Core features (MVP)
- Use more than one API (Nutrition API, Google Vision, Recipe API)
- Responsive design
- TDD (Look into stubbing/mocking functions to help test API requests)
- Dynamic content
- A solid README

## Stretch Goals
- Mobile first
- Nice design (CSS)
- Use local storage or session storage

## Why?
We're creating this website to practice our API querying skills.

One in four British adults is obese. The UK has the highest level of obesity in Western Europe. The [subject matter](http://www.nhs.uk/Livewell/loseweight/Pages/statistics-and-causes-of-the-obesity-epidemic-in-the-UK.aspx) has been chosen to help educate people on food types and nutrition. Obesity levels in the UK have more than trebled in the last 30 years and, on current estimates, more than half the population could be obese by 2050.

## How?
- Using test driven development
- Everyone on the team must write at least one test
- Pair programming

## When?
- We have two days to create this project.
